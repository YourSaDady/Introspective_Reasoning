The six unicorns are going to walk all the way across the forest side-by-side, a journey of 9 kilometers. If each unicorn moves 3 meters forward with each step, how many flowers bloom because of this trip?\n\n<Solution Steps>: ", "answer": "162", "pv_solution": "", "pv_answer": null, "pv_correct": false, "org_solution": "Step0: I will start by identifying the key elements of the problem. The problem involves a specific number of unicorns, a certain distance that the unicorns will travel, and a number of flowers that bloom with each step. I need to figure out the total number of flowers that bloom as a result of this trip.\nStep1: First, I need to determine how many steps each unicorn will take during this trip. To do this, I need to convert the distance from kilometers to meters. Since 1 kilometer is equivalent to 1000 meters, the total distance traveled will be 9 kilometers * 1000 meters/kilometer = 9000 meters.\nStep2: Since each unicorn moves 3 meters with each step, the total number of steps each unicorn will take is 9000 meters / 3 meters/step = 3000 steps.\nStep3: Now that I have the number of steps each unicorn will take, I can determine the total number of flowers that bloom as a result of this trip. Since 4 flowers bloom with each step, the total number of flowers that bloom will be 3000 steps * 4 flowers/step = 12,000 flowers.\nStep4: At this point, I have calculated the total number of flowers that will bloom as a result of the unicorns' trip.\nStep5: Since the problem asks for the number of flowers that bloom because of this trip, I will need to consider whether there are any additional flowers that bloom because of the other unicorns.\nStep6: The total number of flowers that bloom is then the number of flowers each unicorn steps on multiplied by the number of unicorns, but then I need to account for the fact that each unicorn also steps on the ground between each flower.\nStep7: Given the information that everywhere a unicorn steps, four flowers spring into bloom, we can conclude that for every step taken by a unicorn, 4 flowers will bloom.\nStep8: To find the total number of flowers that bloom, we will multiply the number of flower patches created by each unicorn by the total number of unicorns, and in this case, we should simply multiply 3000 steps * 4 flowers/step * 6 unicorns = 72,000 flowers.\nStep9: Therefore, the total number of flowers that bloom because of this trip is 72,000.\nStep10: However, we also need to consider the flowers that bloom on the ground between each pair of unicorns.\nStep11: Therefore, the total number of flowers that bloom is actually more than 72,000, but we still do not have the entire solution.\nStep12: The fact that the problem asks for the number of flowers that bloom because of this trip implies that we should consider all the flowers that bloom because the unicorns move along the ground.\nStep13: Every time that 5 of the unicorns step on the same step, we get 4 new flowers.\nStep14: In each round of 5 unicorns, the total number of new flowers created is $4\\times5=20$ flowers.\nStep15: As the last unicorn steps along with the other 5, it will never create additional new flowers as it only steps when the other unicorns have already stepped.\nStep16: The unicorns will have taken a total of 6 times 3000 = 18000 steps before the last unicorn finishes its journey.\nStep17: Since we have 6 groups of unicorns, each time we get 6 rounds of 20 new flowers, which means a total of 120 flowers are added each group of unicorns.\nStep18: For a group, the last unicorn is not contributing to new flower creation because it can only create a flower when at least one other unicorn is on the step in front of it.\nStep19: As there are five other unicorns that have stepped, a new flower pops up, which leads to $4 \\cdot 4 = 16$ flowers created as a result of each round of unicorns.\nStep20: When all the unicorns in a group have taken one step, 5 additional flowers are created as a result of each group of unicorns, and in total $5 \\cdot 5 = 25$ flowers is created.\nStep21: This situation is unique in the sense that the group that consists of all six unicorns only steps 5 times, unlike the individual unicorns that step 3000 times.\nStep22: Therefore, the total number of flowers created by all the unicorns stepping is $5 \\cdot 25 = 125 flowers.\nStep23: To account for all of the flowers that bloom, we simply add the flowers created in each round and the flowers created by the single step of the group consisting of all the unicorns.\nStep24: The first group of unicorns will create 20 flowers, as each step creates 4 flowers and there are 5 unicorns stepping.\nStep25: In the subsequent $5\\times6=30$ groups of unicorns, each time they take one step, $4\\times5=20$ are the flowers that bloom.\nStep26: Therefore, the 30 other groups of unicorns will create a total of $5\\times30\\times20=3000$ flowers.\nStep27: Because the single group of unicorns takes 6 steps, there are a total of 5 times as many flowers created by these unicorns as by the 30 other groups.\nStep28: Thus, we need to multiply the number of flowers created by a single step of the group of all six unicorns by 5.\nStep29: Multiplying the flowers created by a group by 5 gives $5 \\times 125 = 625$ flowers.\n", "org_ans": null, "org_correct": false}

{"question": "<Problem>: If $321_{b}$ is equal to the base 10 integer 57, find $b$ given that $b>0$.\n\n<Solution Steps>: ", "answer": "14", "pv_solution": "", "pv_answer": null, "pv_correct": false, "org_solution": "Step0: Step 0: $321_b$ is a base $b$ (the subscript signifies that it's in base $b$), so let's first translate this into base 10 to make the problem more understandable.\nStep1: Step 1: To convert $321_b$ into base 10, each digit in the number must be multiplied by a power of $b$.  The first term must be multiplied by $b^2$ because it is located in the $b$ squared place, the next digit must be multiplied by b because it is located in the b place, and the final term must be multiplied by 1 because it is not multiplied by any power of b.\nStep2: Step 2: Once the powers of b have been determined, we can multiply each term with the result.  For the rightmost digit, which is 1, the power is 0 because no power of b can be less than 1.  Therefore, $1 \\cdot b^0 = 1$.  Next, for the middle digit, which is 2, the result is $2 \\cdot b^1 = 2b$.  For the left.\nStep3: Step 3: Now we need to put these values under the 321 expression and use some simple algebra to get the answer.\nStep4: Step 4: Let $3b^2 = the middle term and add to it the first and last terms multiplied by their respective values.\nStep5: Step 5: This equation is equal to 321_b = a base b number. Therefore we can now define a number k of value $57 = x$. And then set 321_b = 57 which gives us the value for $b$ with  $3b^2 + 2b + 1 = 57$.\nStep6: Step 6: We can solve this by first subtracting one from both sides to get $3b^2 + 2b = 56$. Then we subtract 56  from both sides. We get $3b^2 + 2b - 56 = 0$.\nStep7: Step 7: This quadratic equation can be solved by either factoring, completing the square or using the quadratic formula. The last method is the easiest.\nStep8: Step 8: Applying the quadratic formula yields two possible solutions for $b$ which are $b =  {\\frac{-2+ sqrt{(2^2 -4 \\  * 3 *  -56)}}{2 * 3}}$ and $ b = { \\frac{-2-sqrt{(2^2 -4 \\  *  3 *  -56)}}{2 *3}} $.\nStep9: Step 9: By reducing these solutions to their simplest form and choosing the right value from them, we can find if the solution for b is positive since it has the condition $b>0$.\nStep10: Step 10: We can first find the solution for the equation and then we can use this solution as the value of b and determine its minimum value to see at which value the variable is greater than 0.\nStep11: Step 10: We can first find the solution for the equation and then we can use this solution as the value of b and determine its minimum value to see at which value the variable is greater than 0.\nStep12: Step 11: By simplifying the expressions of $b$ in step 8 by using basic algebra with real numbers and performing the following steps.\nStep13: Step 12: By calculating the square root of (-704), we get the value of $\\sqrt{(-704)} = \\sqrt{(-16 * 44)}} = \\sqrt{(-4*16*11)} = \\sqrt{16 *  -4*11}  = 4 \\sqrt{(-44)}  = 4\\sqrt{(- 4) * 11}  = 4 \\cdot  2 * \\sqrt{(-11.\nStep14: Step 13: We can then substitute the value of $-4 \\sqrt{(-44)}$ into the values of $b$ from step 8.\nStep15: Step 14: We get the value of $b = \\ (\\frac{-2+4 \\cdot 2\\sqrt{ 11 }}{6})$.\nStep16: Step 15: If simplify this value and re-arrange the expression with basic algebra we can write it as  $b =\\ (\\frac{1}{3}) \\cdot \\frac{1-2\\sqrt{11}}{1}$.\nStep17: Step 16: The result is that two possible values of $b$ arise from this quadratic equation, which can be written in their simplest form as b = {\\frac{1- 2\\sqrt{11}}{3}} or  b= {\\frac{4\\sqrt{(11)}- 2}{3}}.\nStep18: Step 17: From this, I determine that the two solutions for b = {\\frac{4\\sqrt{11}- 2}{3}} or b= -( {\\frac{1+ 2\\sqrt{11}}{3}} ).\nStep19: Step 18: We can remove the absolute value brackets of these values by multiplying the terms with each of the brackets separately and obtaining the values. These are \\frac{4\\sqrt{11)-2}{3}} \\times -1} or {\\frac{4\\sqrt{11)-2}}{3}} which can easily be obtained. I can then choose one of them.\nStep20: Step 19: There are also terms with an absolute value sign. In order to get rid of it, I can calculate  {\\frac{1+ 2\\sqrt{11))}{3}} \\times -1} or {\\frac{1+ 2\\sqrt{11))}{3}} and determine if the result for $b$ meets the initial condition, where it must be greater than 0.\nStep21: Step 20: Finally I can find that only one of these will be positive.\nStep22: Step 21: The variable b must be a positive number, so only the positive result of $b$ is valid.\nStep23: Step 22: Since I should ignore the other terms with negative signs, I am left with one value that represents $b$. By looking at this expression, it is easy to determine its minimum value.\nStep24: Step 23: After finding the answer to $b$ we must consider only the term that has a positive solution for $b$.\nStep25: Step 24: Since we must have only the value with one the value, b is the minimum of the other values of b which is b \\ge 0.\nStep26: Step 25: The b that is greater than 0 must be calculated and the results for the values of $b$ must be selected one that has a value that is greater than zero but smaller than one and positive so that the condition of b>0 is satisfied and must be  as close to zero as possible.\nStep27: Step 26: Considering the calculations made at step 16, if only one value of b is selected which has a minimum value and greater than 0 but smaller than 1 then the solution to $b$  = {\\frac{1-  2 \\sqrt{11}}{3}}.\nStep28: Step 27: If we simplify the expression we get $b= {\\frac{1-  2 \\ sqrt{(11)}}{3}}$ $ = {\\frac{1}{3}- { \\frac{2 \\sqrt{11}}{3}}{}}$  $=$ (\\frac{1 \\times 3 -  2 \\times  3 \\times \\sqrt{11}}{3 \\   \\  x  3}).\nStep29: Step 28: Next is now to determine the minimum value of $b$ which in order to do this I can divide both numerators and denominators with their greatest common divisor.\n", "org_ans": null, "org_correct": false}
