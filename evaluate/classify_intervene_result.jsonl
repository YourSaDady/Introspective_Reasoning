{"question": "\nYou are going to solve a math problem step by step. Some examples are given: \n<Examples>: \n\nProblem0: Find the cubic polynomial $p(x)$ such that $p(1) = -7,$ $p(2) = -9,$ $p(3) = -15,$ and $p(4) = -31.$\n\nSolution steps: \nStep0: I notice that the values of $p(x)$ are alternating between -7 and -9, depending on whether $x$ is odd or even.\nStep1: This suggests that $p(x)$ might be a quadratic polynomial, since it has a constant term and a linear term.\nStep2: To test this idea, I can try to fit a quadratic polynomial to the given data and see if it works.\nStep3: The quadratic polynomial $q(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ has the form $q(x) = ax^2 + bx - c,$ which is equivalent to $-x^2 + ax + b.$\nStep4: If I let $a = 1$ and $b = 0,$ then the quadratic polynomial has a linear term of $c,$ which must be zero for $x = 1, 2, 3, 4.$\nStep5: This means that $c = 0,$ and I can write $q(x) = x^2 - a.$\nStep6: Now I can plug in the given values of $p(x)$ and see if they match the values of $q(x)$ with $a = 1.$\nStep7: When $x = 1,$ I have $p(1) = -7,$ which matches $q(1) = 1.$\nStep8: When $x = 2,$ I have $p(2) = -9,$ which does not match any value of $q(x).$\nStep9: This means that $a = 1$ is not a valid solution, since it would make $q(x)$ linear and not quadratic.\nStep10: Therefore, I must try another value of $a.$\nStep11: If I let $a = -1,$ then the quadratic polynomial has a linear term of $-c,$ which must be zero for $x = 1, 2, 3, 4.$\nStep12: This means that $c = 0,$ and I can write $q(x) = x^2 + a.$\nStep13: Now I can plug in the given values of $p(x)$ and see if they match the values of $q(x)$ with $a = -1.$\nStep14: When $x = 1,$ I have $p(1) = -7,$ which matches $q(1) = -1.$\nStep15: When $x = 2,$ I have $p(2) = -9,$ which matches $q(2) = -a = -(-1) = 1.$\nStep16: When $x = 3,$ I have $p(3) = -15,$ which matches $q(3) = -1.$\nStep17: When $x = 4,$ I have $p(4) = -31,$ which matches $q(4) = -1.$\nStep18: I have found a solution to the system of equations, where $a = -1$ and $b = 0.$\nStep19: The cubic polynomial $p(x)$ is of the form $p(x) = x^3 + ax^2 - x.$\n\n\n\nProblem1: A tetrahedron with four equilateral triangular faces has a sphere inscribed within it and a sphere circumscribed about it. For each of the four faces, there is a sphere tangent externally to the face at its center and to the circumscribed sphere. A point $P$ is selected at random inside the circumscribed sphere. The probability that $P$ lies inside one of the five small spheres is closest to\n$\\mathrm{(A) \\ }0 \\qquad \\mathrm{(B) \\ }0.1 \\qquad \\mathrm{(C) \\ }0.2 \\qquad \\mathrm{(D) \\ }0.3 \\qquad \\mathrm{(E) \\ }0.4$\n\nSolution steps: \nStep0: The volume of the circumscribed sphere is four times the volume of each small sphere.\nStep1: Since the point $P$ is selected at random inside the circumscribed sphere,\nStep2: the probability that $P$ lies inside one of the five small spheres is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$\n\n\n\nProblem2: The function $f(x) = x + 1$ generates the sequence\n\\[1, \\ 2, \\ 3, \\ 4, \\ \\dots\\]in the sense that plugging any number in the sequence into $f(x)$ gives the next number in the sequence.\n\nWhat rational function $g(x)$ generates the sequence\n\\[\\frac{1}{2}, \\ \\frac{2}{3}, \\ \\frac{3}{4}, \\ \\frac{4}{5}, \\ \\dots\\]in this manner?\n\nSolution steps: \nStep0: I notice that the sequence $\\frac{1}{2}, \\ \\frac{2}{3}, \\ \\frac{3}{4}, \\ \\frac{4}{5}, \\ \\dots$ is also arithmetic, in the sense that each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a common ratio.\nStep1: The common ratio is $\\frac{3}{4}$, since the sequence is equivalent to $\\frac{3}{4} \\cdot (\\frac{2}{3} \\cdot (\\frac{3}{4} \\cdot (\\frac{4}{5} \\cdot (\\frac{5}{6} \\cdot (\\frac{6}{7} \\cdot (\\frac{7}{8} \\cdot (\\frac{8}{9} \\cdot (\\frac{9}{10} \\cdot (\\frac{10}{11} \\cdot (\\frac{11}{12} \\cdot (\\frac{12}{13} \\cdot (\\frac{13}{14})))))))))))))).$\nStep2: This means that the sequence is also a geometric sequence, where each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by $\\frac{3}{4}$.\nStep3: Therefore, the function $g(x)$ that generates the sequence must also be of the form $g(x) = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot x$, since multiplying by $\\frac{3}{4}$ is the same as adding $\\frac{3}{4}$.\nStep4: To check if this function works, I can plug in any term in the sequence and see if it satisfies the definition of $g(x)$.\nStep5: For example, if I plug in $\\frac{1}{2}$, I get $\\frac{3}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{6}{4} = \\frac{5}{4}$, which is a term in the sequence.\nStep6: Similarly, I can plug in $\\frac{2}{3}$ and get $\\frac{3}{4} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{12}{4} = \\frac{3}{2}$, which is also a term in the sequence.\nStep7: I can continue this process for any term in the sequence and see that $g(x) = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot x$ works for all of them.\nStep8: Therefore, $g(x) = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot x$ is the rational function that generates the sequence $\\frac{1}{2}, \\ \\frac{2}{3}, \\ \\frac{3}{4}, \\ \\frac{4}{5}, \\ \\dots$\n\n\n\nProblem3: The sum of two numbers is 15. Four times the smaller number is 60 less than twice the larger number. What is the larger number?\n\nSolution steps: \nStep0: I need to find two numbers that add up to 15 and satisfy another condition involving their multiples.\nStep1: Let me call the smaller number x and the larger number y, so I have x + y = 15 and 4x = 2y - 60.\nStep2: I can try to solve this system of equations by substitution or elimination.\nStep3: Substitution might be easier, since I can easily isolate x or y from the first equation.\nStep4: If I solve for y, I get y = 15 - x, and then I can plug that into the second equation.\nStep5: So I have 4x = 2(15 - x) - 60, which simplifies to 4x = 30 - 2x - 60, and then to 6x = -30.\nStep6: Dividing both sides by 6, I get x = -5.\nStep7: That means the smaller number is -5, and the larger number is 15 - (-5) = 20.\nStep8: I can check this by plugging it back into the original equations.\nStep9: Indeed, -5 + 20 = 15 and 4(-5) = 2(20) - 60, so I'm confident I have the correct numbers\n\n\n\nProblem4: If $f(x)$ is a function defined only for X \\le x \\le 1$, and $f(x) = ax+b$ for constants $a$ and $b$ where $a < 0$, then what is the range of $f$ in terms of $a$ and $b$? Express your answer in interval notation. I'm sorry, but you did not provide a question and answer pair for me to rewrite. Please provide a question and answer pair for me to assist you. What is the value of unknown variable X?\n\nSolution steps: \nStep0: To solve this problem, we need to determine the range of the function $f(x)$.\nStep1: Since $a < 0$, the function $f(x)$ is a decreasing function.\nStep2: The smallest possible value of $f(x)$ occurs at $x = 1$, which is $a(1) + b = a + b$.\nStep3: The largest possible value of $f(x)$ occurs at $x = X$, which is $a(X) + b = aX + b$.\nStep4: Therefore, the range of $f$ is the interval $\\boxed{[a+b, aX+b]}$\n\n\n\nProblem5: Find the positive difference between the solutions for $|x + 3| = 6$.\n\nSolution steps: \nStep0: I know that the absolute value of an expression is always positive, so there is no need to consider the sign of $x + 3$.\nStep1: I also know that the absolute value of an expression is equal to the expression itself if it is positive, and equal to the opposite of the expression if it is negative.\nStep2: So, I can rewrite the equation as two separate cases: either $x + 3 = 6$ or $x + 3 = -6$.\nStep3: Solving for $x$ in each case, I get $x = 3$ or $x = -9$.\nStep4: The positive difference between these solutions is the absolute value of their difference: $|3 - (-9)| = |12| = 12$\n\n\n\nProblem6: Let $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ be angles such that\n\\begin{align*}\n\\cos x &= \\tan y, \\\\\n\\cos y &= \\tan z, \\\\\n\\cos z &= \\tan x.\n\\end{align*}Find the largest possible value of $\\sin x.$\n\nSolution steps: \nStep0: This problem involves trigonometric identities and equations, so I will try to use them to simplify the expressions.\nStep1: I notice that the cosine of an angle is equal to the tangent of another angle, so I can use the reciprocal identity to rewrite them as sines.\nStep2: For example, $\\cos x = \\tan y$ implies that $\\sin x = \\frac{1}{\\cos x} = \\frac{1}{\\tan y}.$\nStep3: Similarly, $\\cos y = \\tan z$ implies that $\\sin y = \\frac{1}{\\cos y} = \\frac{1}{\\tan z},$ and $\\cos z = \\tan x$ implies that $\\sin z = \\frac{1}{\\cos z} = \\frac{1}{\\tan x}.$\nStep4: Now I have three expressions for the sines of $x, y,$ and $z$ in terms of the tangents of $y, z,$ and $x.$\nStep5: I want to find the largest possible value of $\\sin x,$ so I will try to maximize it using the arithmetic mean-geometric mean inequality.\nStep6: The AM-GM inequality says that for any nonnegative numbers $a$ and $b,$ the arithmetic mean $\\frac{a+b}{2}$ is greater than or equal to the geometric mean $\\sqrt{ab}.$\nStep7: Applying this inequality to $\\sin x$ and $\\frac{1}{\\tan y},$ I get that $\\sin x \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\tan y} \\geq \\frac{\\sin x + \\frac{1}{\\tan y}}{2}.$\nStep8: Simplifying this inequality, I get that $\\sin x \\cdot \\tan y \\geq \\sin x + \\frac{1}{\\tan y}.$\nStep9: This inequality is equivalent to $\\sin x \\cdot (\\tan y - 1) \\geq \\sin x,$ or $\\sin x (\\tan y - 1 - \\sin x) \\geq 0.$\nStep10: Since $\\sin x$ and $\\tan y - 1 - \\sin x$ are both nonnegative, this inequality holds if and only if they are both zero.\nStep11: This implies that $\\sin x = 0$ or $\\tan y - 1 - \\sin x = 0,$ or equivalently, $\\sin x = \\frac{1}{\\tan y}$ or $\\sin x = \\tan y - 1.$\nStep12: But I also know that $\\sin x = \\frac{1}{\\tan y}$ by the first equation, so the only possibility is $\\sin x = \\tan y - 1.$\nStep13: This means that the maximum value of $\\sin x$ is achieved when $\\sin x = \\tan y - 1,$ and this occurs when $\\tan y - 1$ is positive and less than or equal to $\\sin x.$\nStep14: Since $\\tan y$ is always positive, this happens when $\\tan y \\leq \\sin x + 1.$\nStep15: But $\\tan y = \\cos x,$ so this is equivalent to $\\cos x \\leq \\sin x + 1.$\n\n\n\nProblem7: Find $1^{234} + 4^6 \\div 4^4$.\n\nSolution steps: \nStep0: To simplify this expression, I will use the properties of exponents and order of operations.\nStep1: First, I notice that $1^{234}$ is just 1, since any power of 1 is 1.\nStep2: So I can rewrite the expression as $1 + 4^6 \\div 4^4$.\nStep3: Next, I notice that $4^6 \\div 4^4$ can be simplified by subtracting the exponents, since they have the same base.\nStep4: So I can rewrite the expression as $1 + 4^{6 - 4}$.\nStep5: This gives me $1 + 4^2$, which is $1 + 16$.\nStep6: Finally, I can add these two terms to get the answer\n\n\n\n\nGiven the examples above, solve the following problem by completing the solution steps below: \n<Problem>: In a class of Mr. Sanchez, the students were given a task to add two positive integers.
