First, we need to find out how many steps each unicorn will take to walk 9 kilometers.

There are 1000 meters in a kilometer, so 9 kilometers is equal to 9000 meters.\n\n2. Now, we can find out how many steps each unicorn will take. To do this, we need to divide the total distance (9000 meters) by the distance each unicorn moves with each step (3 meters). This gives us 9000 \u00f7 3 = 3000 steps.\n\n3. Since there are 6 unicorns, and each unicorn takes 3000 steps, the total number of steps is 6 \u00d7 3000 = 18,000 steps.\n\n4. Now, we need to find out how many flowers bloom for each step.
